# Railway Reservation System - Mini Project ðŸš†

## Overview
This mini-project is a **Railway Reservation System** built using **Python**.

### Key Features:
- **Ticket Booking**: Users can book tickets for trains by entering their details.
- **Ticket ID Generation**: The system generates a unique ticket ID for each booking using the `Random` and `String` modules.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: The interface is designed using **Tkinter** for a seamless and intuitive user experience.
- **Image Display**: Images such as train pictures or logos are displayed using the **PIL** (Pillow) library.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter**: For creating graphical user interface (GUI).
- **PIL (Pillow)**: For displaying images on the interface.
- **Random**: For generating random numbers (used in ticket ID generation).
- **String**: For string manipulation (used in ticket ID creation).
